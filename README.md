# Draw-and-Collect
An interactive physics game that combines Computer Vision and real-time physics simulation. The player uses their finger gestures, detected through MediaPipe and OpenCV, to draw shapes in the air. These air-drawn shapes are displayed on the screen as physical objects where they interact under gravity and collisions.
