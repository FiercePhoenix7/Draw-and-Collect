# Draw-and-Collect
An interactive physics game that combines Computer Vision and real-time physics simulation. The player uses their finger gestures, detected through MediaPipe and OpenCV, to draw shapes in the air. These air-drawn shapes are displayed on the screen as physical objects where they interact under gravity and collisions.

The objective of the game is to guide falling balls into a cup placed on the screen. Players must creatively draw ramps, walls, or barriers to direct the balls into the cup. The number of balls rises by one after every level, challenging the player’s timing and precision.
